A selection of tools to change display settings while SSHd into your machine that can be executed.

I do not take any responsibility for anything that happens while you use these tools. Please be mindful that some of these may
impact your system in a way that may not be deemed satisfactory.
If you are using these tools on someone elses machine then good on you because they should not have given out thier credentials 
or private SSH key to you and they deserve to be messed with for being so foolish.

I will not provide instructions on how to obtain credentials or a private SSH key from another person(s). That is your job to find
out as you should really only be doing this on your own machine.

All the best and have fun!

These are some useful commands 
-listall - Shows a list of all available commands
-end - end the program
-default - set the settings back to default

*More to come as I implement them
